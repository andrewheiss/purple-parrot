abstract: |
  Research on human rights repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to protect legitimacy and curb challenges to state power. Such repression tends to draw ire from the international community and can be counterproductive at achieving its aims. To avoid this, states employ subtler and less violent forms of repression designed to demobilize popular advocacy and capture the benefits of civil society organizations. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society. Because it looks like more standard domestic regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry and condemnation, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even act as a "canary in the coal mine" and signal future physical repression. This is a significant argument, suggesting that previous research may undercount repression by only looking at physical violence rather than more innocuous legal and policy-oriented avenues of repression. The author recalls their experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different national jurisdictions and measuring different forms of de jure and de facto restrictions, presents key results, and outlines avenues for future research.

# Structure

In order to ensure coherence within each section and across all sections please follow this structure when drafting your chapter:

1. Present well-known human rights ideas and problematize their conceptualization and measurement, particularly as it relates to quantification, addressing:

   - What questions have scholars asked about this concept (e.g., repression)?
   - How has this concept traditionally been measured or operationalized?
   - What have been the core findings of research in this vein?
   - What advancements did scholars make in the research area's early years and what gaps or questions did they leave open?

2. Give a play-by-play of how you planned and executed your novel data collections, including:

   - What options did you face?
   - What judgment calls did you make about what was the best (and most feasible) data to collect?
   - Essentially, how and why did you build your data?

3. Showcase key findings from your analyses and discuss what we know now that we could not have known otherwise.

4. Lay out next steps/outline an agenda for future research, including:

   - Acknowledgement of shortcomings in the existing data collection effort
   - Suggestions for new concepts to be measured
   - Suggestions for improved ways of capturing other related concepts using similar techniques.
