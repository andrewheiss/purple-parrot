  {"id":"Cartwright:2016","abstract":"This paper argues that government inaction can be a tool for extracting rents. Politicians can harness government's power to selectively enforce laws and threaten enforcement in exchange for compliance with their demands. Selective enforcement is an attractive rent extraction method for lawmakers because it increases the credibility of their threats, allows them economize on the legislative process, minimizes the amount of voters their actions might offend, and allows them to capitalize on the economies of scale and scope the state's coercive power creates in an environment with selective enforcement. This mechanism suggests that zoning laws are ripe for selective enforcement, and provides a case study to support the thesis that observed selective enforcement in zoning is often rent extraction.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Cartwright","given":"Alexander C."}],"citation-key":"Cartwright:2016","container-title":"Public Finance and Management","container-title-short":"Public Finance and Management","DOI":"10.1177/152397211601600105","ISSN":"1523-9721, 1523-9721","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",3]]},"language":"en","license":"https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","page":"75-93","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Selective enforcement and rent extraction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/152397211601600105","volume":"16"},

  {"id":"ClayBakkerBrook:2020","abstract":"Most cross-national datasets of civil and political rights practices have relied on internationally distributed English language secondary sources as the core source of information for their metrics. This approach has yielded data that are highly reliable, but also suffer from the fact that their information sources under-represent the overall level of abuse internationally and do so in a way that is biased across countries. The combined knowledge of the individual human rights practitioners working to directly monitor the abuses occurring within a country would likely serve to overcome much of this biased under-reporting, but it is difficult to compare that knowledge across country and cultural contexts. In this article, we discuss how we overcome these problems in the Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) civil and political rights data. Using an expert survey that contains anchoring vignettes in concert with Bayesian scaling techniques, we present a new methodology for collecting and aggregating data on the intensity and distribution of respect for eight separate civil and political rights.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Clay","given":"K Chad"},{"family":"Bakker","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Brook","given":"Anne-Marie"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Daniel W"},{"family":"Murdie","given":"Amanda"}],"citation-key":"ClayBakkerBrook:2020","container-title":"Journal of Peace Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Peace Research","DOI":"10.1177/0022343320959688","ISSN":"0022-3433, 1460-3578","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","page":"715-727","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Using practitioner surveys to measure human rights: The Human Rights Measurement Initiative’s civil and political rights metrics","title-short":"Using practitioner surveys to measure human rights","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022343320959688","volume":"57"},

  {"id":"DeMattee:2020","abstract":"A single topic unifies my dissertation chapters: how and why do governments regulate civil society organizations (CSOs)? Three sets of research questions engage this topic using a multi-method research design. My first set is descriptive: what exists in the range of legal provisions governments use to regulate CSOs and how often do governments enact these provisions? In the second set of questions, I examine policy adoption, asking: under what conditions do governments enact various CSO regulation? Then, to what extent are these legal institutions path dependent—meaning, shaped by current laws and institutions—and to what extent are they affected by international factors and influences? And why do nondemocratic governments enact permissive provisions more frequently than restrictive ones? Finally, the third set of questions examines enforcement, asking under what conditions do governments enforce these provisions? Do de facto rules always match de jure rules, and if not, why not?My dissertation speaks to what human rights defenders identify as a growing number of governments enacting new, restrictive CSO laws—a trend referred to as the “closing space” phenomenon. This pattern is concerning, and we cannot afford to misunderstand it. The conventional explanation is that governments use these CSO laws to maintain power by rattling social cohesion and weakening democratic opposition. Discourse within the literature suggests that democracies pass permissive laws that protect the freedom of association, while autocracies and hybrid regimes pass restrictive laws that hinder voluntary association. What is more, the traditional argument frames these laws as a relatively new phenomenon beginning in the late twentieth century. Yet closely examining primary legal sources reveals a puzzling, non-trivial number of exceptions to these rules. One type of exception is that nondemocratic regimes frequently enact permissive provisions. Another type is that CSO laws are not new and often predate a country’s independence. If these legal institutions are neither categorically restrictive nor necessarily new as we once thought, why do governments enact them, and how do they enforce them to regulate CSOs?My theory argues that a government uses both CSO laws and regulatory enforcement actions to maintain political control and to expand legitimacy among its citizenry and the international community. A government whose grip on power is secure uses legal rules to provide CSOs with greater operational space that directly and indirectly bolsters its legitimacy. When a regime’s grip on control is fragile, the government manipulates legal rules and enforcement actions to observe civil society and control CSOs. This theory applies to all regime types and levels of development.I test my theory using five methods and four datasets. Among the data analyzed is a novel dataset created by systematically and holistically coding 285 laws enacted by 17 countries between 1872 and 2019. Twelve are East African countries; the remaining cases are the Permanent Members of the UN Security Council. A single-country case study of Kenya completes my research design. Using site-intensive methods, I collected archived government records and interviewed elected officials, bureaucrats, and CSO regulators. Qualitative analysis triangulates my findings to identify causal processes. My primary findings are that the legal institutions that regulate CSOs, what I introduce as “CSO regulatory regimes,” are neither new nor categorically restrictive. Regulatory regimes are instead historically informed, rewritten at different moments in different ways, and enforced inconsistently for political expediency. In its simplest form, my argument is that governments tactically alter their regulatory regime’s contents and enforcement as part of a broader strategy to increase their legitimacy and control. Governments maintain the status quo—both written rules and enforcement actions—as long as the current regulatory regime achieves the government’s aims. When change is necessary, governments alter enforcement actions, enact new provisions and enforce them as written, or enact provisions with the intention of sabotaging their enforcement.Enacting or not enacting a particular CSO law does not guarantee civil society’s environment will open or close. To truly understand whether a law “helps” or “hinders,” we must know the law’s contents and see how the government enforces it. I consider these matters as I explore how and why governments use CSO laws to domesticate civil society.","author":[{"family":"DeMattee","given":"Anthony James"}],"citation-key":"DeMattee:2020","event-place":"Bloomington, Indiana","genre":"Ph.D.","ISBN":"9798672190846","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9]]},"language":"English","note":"ProQuest number: 28148186","number-of-pages":"364","publisher":"Indiana University","publisher-place":"Bloomington, Indiana","title":"Domesticating civil society: How and why governments use laws to regulate CSOs","type":"thesis","URL":"https://www.proquest.com/docview/2456130772"},

  {"id":"FransenDupuy:2024","abstract":"Abstract\n            Does the adoption of restrictive regulations shape numbers of non-governmental organizations? Since the late 1990s, governments around the world have been enacting new legal measures designed to suppress civil society’s functions and organizational space to carry out advocacy and politically oriented work. Scholars have investigated the impact of these new regulations on foreign aid flows, voting behavior, and on organizations, but to date, we lack a systematic analysis about the cross-national global effects of these legal restrictions on numbers of international non-governmental organizations (INGOs) in particular, since it is these organizations (and their funders) that have been heavily targeted. In this research note, we fill this gap through an empirical analysis of the effects of various types of restrictive laws on INGO numbers in 96 countries between 1992 and 2018 and find that advocacy restrictions result in a reduction of transnational human rights organizations but not numbers of INGOs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Fransen","given":"Luc"},{"family":"Dupuy","given":"Kendra E."}],"citation-key":"FransenDupuy:2024","container-title":"International Journal of Politics, Culture, and Society","container-title-short":"Int J Polit Cult Soc","DOI":"10.1007/s10767-024-09474-5","ISSN":"0891-4486, 1573-3416","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",9]]},"language":"en","page":"433-445","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Death by law: Restrictive regulations and INGO numbers","title-short":"Death by law","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10767-024-09474-5","volume":"37"},

  {"id":"HaltermanBagozziBeger:2023","abstract":"POLECAT is a new global political event dataset intended to serve as the successor to the dataset produced by the DARPA Integrated Conflict Early Warning System (ICEWS) project.  POLECAT's event data are machine coded from millions of multi-language international news reports and will soon cover the period 2010-to-present. These data are generated using the Next Generation Event Coder (NGEC), a new automated coder that replaces the use of extensive (and difficult to update) dictionaries with a more flexible set of expert annotations of an event's characteristics.  In contrast to existing automated event coders, it uses a combination of NLP tools, transformer-based neural networks, and actor information sourced from Wikipedia. POLECAT's event data are based on an event-mode-context ontology, the Political Language Ontology for Verifiable Event Records (PLOVER), that replaces the older CAMEO ontology used in past datasets such as ICEWS and Phoenix. These innovations offer substantial improvements in the scope and accuracy of political event data in terms of the what, how, why, where, and when of domestic and international  interactions. After detailing PLOVER and POLECAT, we illustrate the innovations and improvements through a preliminary comparison to the existing-ICEWS event data system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Halterman","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Bagozzi","given":"Benjamin E."},{"family":"Beger","given":"Andreas"},{"family":"Schrodt","given":"Phil"},{"family":"Scraborough","given":"Grace"}],"citation-key":"HaltermanBagozziBeger:2023","DOI":"10.31235/osf.io/rm5dw","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,3]]},"license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode","publisher":"SocArXiv","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"PLOVER and POLECAT: A new political event ontology and dataset","title-short":"PLOVER and POLECAT","type":"article","URL":"https://osf.io/rm5dw"},

  {"id":"LianMurdie:2023","abstract":"A crackdown on the activities of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) has recently swept the globe. When faced with increased restrictions, how do NGOs respond? We argue there is a curvilinear relationship between increases in NGO repression and the conflict-to-cooperative nature of NGO interactions with a government. On one end of the spectrum, when civil society repression is limited or nonexistent, NGOs have many reasons to be cooperative with the government. As NGO repression increases, we should see NGOs take more of a conflictual stance, publicly voicing their displeasure and bringing attention to the abuses and deficiencies they see within the regime. As NGO repression continues to increase, however, there will be a tipping point at which the NGOs that remain in the country will once again take a more cooperative tack with the government. We use a quantitative event data approach to examine the implications of our arguments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Lian","given":"Shanshan"},{"family":"Murdie","given":"Amanda"}],"citation-key":"LianMurdie:2023","container-title":"Journal of Human Rights","DOI":"10.1080/14754835.2022.2158723","ISSN":"1475-4835","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,8]]},"page":"431-450","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"How closing civil society space affects NGO-government interactions","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/14754835.2022.2158723","volume":"22"},

Drawing on multiple focus groups and interviews with grassroots NGOs around China, the article highlights gaps between NGO leaders’ understandings of their work and several of the law’s key provisions, revealing civil society’s skepticism and pessimism about prospects for change.

  {"id":"WangPangLin:2024","abstract":"Text classification is fundamental in Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized the field. This paper introduces an adaptable and reliable text classification paradigm, which leverages LLMs as the core component to address text classification tasks. Our system simplifies the traditional text classification workflows, reducing the need for extensive preprocessing and domain-specific expertise to deliver adaptable and reliable text classification results. We evaluated the performance of several LLMs, machine learning algorithms, and neural network-based architectures on four diverse datasets. Results demonstrate that certain LLMs surpass traditional methods in sentiment analysis, spam SMS detection, and multi-label classification. Furthermore, it is shown that the system's performance can be further enhanced through few-shot or fine-tuning strategies, making the fine-tuned model the top performer across all datasets.
