> Andrew Heiss, “Measuring Repression through Restrictions on Civil Society”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Abstract

Research on repression often focuses on how states use physical violence to curb challenges to their power. Such repression can backfire—drawing criticism from abroad and weakening power at home. To avoid this, states may employ subtler and less violent forms of repression to demobilize popular advocacy. This chapter explores how authoritarian regimes use nonviolent administrative crackdown through anti-civil society laws to limit and co-opt domestic and international civil society groups. Because it looks like standard regulation, administrative crackdown attracts far less international outcry, while accomplishing similar aims as violent repression. Anti-civil society laws can even signal future physical repression. But by focusing on physical violence and neglecting bureaucratic actions, existing research undercounts repression. The author recalls his experience exploring this more hidden form of repression, discusses the challenge of collecting and harmonizing administrative data from different countries, and explains how he measures various *de jure* and *de facto* restrictions.

## 🟣🦜: Note on “purple parrot” project name

Because project titles change all the time with revisions, rewriting, and peer review, I used [{codename}](http://svmiller.com/codename/) to generate an [Ubuntu-style](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames) internal-to-me project name that won’t change.

``` r
library(codename)
codename_message()
#> code name generated by {codename} v.0.5.0. R version 4.4.2 (2024-10-31).

codename(seed = "cs repression hr", type = "ubuntu")
#> [1] "purple parrot"
